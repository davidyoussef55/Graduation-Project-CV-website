<h2> These tips may increase your chances of success when applying online: </h3>
<h3>
<ol>
                <li>Read the job description carefully. Make sure you have the skills and experience that the employer is looking for. Think about previous situations when you demonstrated the relevant skills and behaviours the employer requires and how you could clearly express this in your application.</li>
<hr width="70%">                
<li>Tailor your application. You must tailor your cover letter and résumé to the specific employer and ensure you include keywords in your application. Many online recruiters use IT programs to scan and automatically discard applications that don’t include specific words.</li>
                <li>Fill out every field in the application. This is an easy way to provide as much information as you can while demonstrating your interest and enthusiasm for the job. Attention to detail is important to make sure your application is complete and error-free.</li>
<hr width="70%">                 
<li>Review your social media profile. If you are applying for jobs online, make sure you have a positive online presence. Many employers will look you up online to verify the claims in your application. You should check your social media privacy settings to ensure employers can’t access any information you would rather they didn’t see. For more information read our article ‘Manage your digital identity’. </li>
<hr width="70%">                 
<li>Triple-check your content for spelling, content, and grammar mistakes. Review your application before you submit it. Once you click ‘submit’ your information is sent directly to the recruiter. Remember that first impressions count, so make the best one you can when you apply. </li>
                <li>When applying for work, the most likely outcome is that you'll get a lot of rejections before you land a job. Instead of getting discouraged, learn from your mistakes and keep applying until you get the right offer.</li>
<hr width="70%">                 
<li>Networks are an essential component of a successful job search. Most jobs are found through networking, whether it’s online or in-person. You never know who can help you find your next position unless you tell your connections you’re looking for a job.</li>
<hr width="70%">                 
<li>Job hunting can feel as though you're playing a multitasking game to try to keep up. There's so much you need to pay attention to when you want to impress a prospective employer.</li>
<hr width="70%">                 
<li>Make sure you know what the employer is asking for with our job ad glossary and respond so that the person reading can see exactly how your skills and experience match. There will be specific words and phrases they use to describe their ideal candidate, so reference these in your application.</li>
                <li>A cover letter is a document that you submit alongside your CV that introduces you to the employer and gives you a chance to talk directly to them, emphasising your enthusiasm for the organisation and the role. If there is an opportunity to submit one, you should (even if it’s not mandatory) as it will add to your chances of standing out. Read more about cover letters here.</li>
